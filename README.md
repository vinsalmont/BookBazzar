# Password Handling Feature - README

## Overview

This project includes a feature for handling user passwords securely. It encompasses functionalities such as **showing/hiding the password** during input, **password validation**, and **error messaging** for improper password formats. The structure is modular to ensure easy maintenance, scalability, and security.

## Architecture

The password handling feature follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and making the UI reactive to state changes, such as password visibility and validation.

### 1. **Model (UserSession)**
   - Manages the **business logic** of password security (e.g., checking if the password meets complexity requirements, handling user authentication).
   - Holds the user's login session and password state.
   
### 2. **ViewModel (PasswordViewModel)**
   - Responsible for the **password visibility toggle** and **validation logic**.
   - Interacts with the `UserSession` model to determine if the password is valid and updates the state of the view accordingly.
   - Handles state management for showing/hiding the password, detecting input changes, and managing error messages.

### 3. **View (PasswordFieldView)**
   - Displays the **password input field** with the option to show/hide the password using a toggle button (e.g., an eye icon).
   - Implements bindings to the **ViewModel** to update the UI based on user actions (e.g., showing error messages, showing/hiding the password).
   - This is the **SwiftUI** component responsible for the user interface and interactions.

### **File Breakdown**:

1. **`UserSession.swift`**:
   - **Location**: `Models/`
   - **Purpose**: Manages the user session and password-related business logic (e.g., checking if the password meets security requirements). This is the source of truth for determining if a password is valid and holds the userâ€™s state for authentication.
   
2. **`PasswordViewModel.swift`**:
   - **Location**: `ViewModels/`
   - **Purpose**: The `ViewModel` handles the password toggle (show/hide), validation state, and other business logic to communicate with the `UserSession`. It acts as the intermediary between the model and the view, maintaining the state needed for the password-related UI.

3. **`PasswordFieldView.swift`**:
   - **Location**: `Views/`
   - **Purpose**: Implements the **password input field**, including the logic to show/hide the password. This view listens to the state provided by the `PasswordViewModel` and updates the UI accordingly. It also provides feedback to the user, such as validation errors or visibility toggles.

4. **`LoginView.swift`**:
   - **Location**: `Views/`
   - **Purpose**: Handles the login form, including the password input field. It uses the `PasswordFieldView` as a subview for user interaction. The **login form** will be validated before passing data to the authentication mechanism.

5. **`Localizable.strings`**:
   - **Location**: `Resources/`
   - **Purpose**: Contains localized strings for error messages and UI text for the password feature (e.g., "Password must be at least 8 characters", "Show Password").

## Key Functionalities

### 1. **Show/Hide Password**:
   - The password input field provides an eye icon for toggling between showing and hiding the password text.
   - This functionality is managed by the `PasswordViewModel`, which holds the state of `isSecured` (i.e., whether the password is hidden or visible).

### 2. **Password Validation**:
   - The system checks whether the password meets specific requirements (e.g., minimum length, containing special characters).
   - The `UserSession` is responsible for validating the password, while the `PasswordViewModel` ensures that the validation state is reflected in the UI.
   - Validation errors, if any, are displayed below the password field in the form of an error message.

### 3. **Password Management and Security**:
   - The app follows best practices to handle sensitive information like passwords, ensuring that the password input is secured and that the app does not store sensitive information unnecessarily.
   - Secure password storage and handling are essential and managed by the `UserSession`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Validations**: You can extend the validation logic by adding more complex checks like password entropy, special characters, and unique passwords for better security.
- **Biometric Integration**: Consider integrating with Face ID or Touch ID for seamless authentication in the future.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand `Localizable.strings` for multi-language support to enhance global usability.
